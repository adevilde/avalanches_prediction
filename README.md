## Introduction

Avalanches pose a significant threat to outdoor enthusiasts, ski patrol teams, and mountain communities. Predicting avalanche risk accurately is crucial for ensuring safety in mountainous regions. This challenge aims to leverage data science to analyze and forecast avalanche risk based on historical reports from Météo-France. By processing and interpreting structured data extracted from avalanche risk bulletins, we can improve preparedness and decision-making in avalanche-prone areas.  

The data for this challenge comes from **Météo-France** through the **Bulletins d'Estimation du Risque d'Avalanche (BERA)**, which provide official assessments of avalanche hazards. Originally, these reports were only available in PDF format, making them difficult to analyze systematically. However, [multi-coop](https://gitlab.com/multi-coop/meteofrance_bra_hist) has extracted and structured this data into CSV files, categorized by mountain region (massif) and publication date.

The dataset consists of **34,286 records**, each representing a daily avalanche risk bulletin for a specific massif. It includes **47 features**, covering information on:
- **Avalanche risk levels (`risque1`, `risque2`, `risque_maxi`)** at different altitudes.
- **Geographic and temporal data (`massif`, `altitude`, `date`)**.
- **Weather conditions (`isotherme_0`, `precipitation_neige_veille_epaisseur`, `vent_altitude_*`)**.
- **Risk evolution trends (`evolurisque1`, `evolurisque2`)**.

This dataset provides a historical record of avalanche risk conditions, making it a valuable resource for predictive modeling.

The main objective of this challenge is to **predict avalanche risk in France** based on the structured BERA data. By analyzing historical risk reports and meteorological conditions, we can develop models that estimate avalanche hazards more effectively.  

This task has multiple applications. First, it can help outdoor enthusiasts, ski patrols, and mountain rescue teams plan safer routes and make informed decisions before heading into avalanche-prone terrain. Additionally, the challenge aims to serve as an educational tool for analyzing past avalanche incidents, helping researchers and safety experts understand risk factors. Finally, by improving real-time risk estimation models, the challenge contributes to broader efforts in avalanche forecasting and disaster prevention.  

Avalanches are a deadly natural hazard, posing risks to skiers, snowboarders, mountaineers, and local communities. Developing accurate avalanche prediction models can save lives by providing crucial insights into when and where avalanches are most likely to occur.  

Improved avalanche forecasting enhances safety measures for ski resorts, backcountry travelers, and rescue operations. It also contributes to environmental and climate research, as avalanche behavior is influenced by broader weather patterns and climate change. By transforming unstructured reports into actionable insights, this challenge harnesses the power of data science to improve preparedness and response in mountainous regions.

## Getting started

### Install

To run a submission and the notebook you will need the dependencies listed
in `requirements.txt`. You can install install the dependencies with the
following command-line:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using `conda`, we provide an `environment.yml` file for similar
usage.
